Carton::Doc::Check - Check if your cpanfile and local environment are in sync

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  carton check

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command checks the consisntency between yoru cpanfile and the
local environment.

=head2 MISSING MODULES

If one of the modules specified in your I<cpanfile> are not found in
your local environment, C<carton check> will warn you about this:

  $ carton check
  Following dependencies are not satisfied. Run `carton install` to install them.
  JSON (2.00)

You can run C<carton install> again to reinstall these missing dependencies.

=head2 UNUSED MODULES

If one of the modules in the local environment (i.e. I<local> library
path) are not specified in your I<cpanfile>, you'll get a warning like
this:

  $ carton check
  Following modules are found in local but couldn't be tracked from your cpanfile
  CGI.pm-3.55
    FCGI-0.73

This means you probably installed this module in an ad-hoc mode so you
have to add it to I<cpanfile>, or you originally declared the
dependencies but found out that you don't need it, so deleted from
your I<cpanfile>. In that case you can uninstall the module with the
L<uninstall|Plack::Doc::Uninstall> command.
