        - Fixed bug where version range requirements are not properly preserved in the snapshot #117 (lestrrat)

        - This makes 1.0 release
        - Documentation update
        - Bump cpanm dependency

v0.9.68  2013-07-26 17:49:28 PDT
        - Change the distribution name case, to match with the module name
        - Add Module::CoreList as a dependency for perl 5.8

v0.9.67  2013-07-24 14:53:53 PDT
        - Use cpanm's fatscript interface rather than share dir

v0.9.66  2013-07-24 08:46:27 PDT
        - Correctly raises an exception when badly formatted snapshot file is read
        - Fixed a bug in tree scanner where seen hash is not preserved
        - tree scanner should be much faster for giant set of dependencies

v0.9.65  2013-07-23 18:51:59 PDT
        - BIG CHANGE: Use cpanfile.snapshot instead of carton.lock for 1.0 onwards
          There is no way to migrate carton.lock to cpanfile.snapshot just yet.
        - New cpanfile.snapshot is text based and is more VCS friendly
        - Reworked internal of prereqs/requirements loader (again!) to eliminate
          lots of duplicate code

v0.9.64  2013-07-23 14:39:54 PDT
        - Locate cpanm within a dist share dir so that cpanm in user's $PATH is not executed.
          This will solve issues with cpanm in /usr/bin, perlbrew or with bad shebang #92

v0.9.63  2013-07-23 02:26:04 PDT

        - Implement carton check which checks if cpanfile requirements is satisfied locally with lock
        - Implement carton update!
        - Fix the installation collector logic to ignore dists that don't satisfy cpanfile

v0.9.54  2013-06-02 12:38:20 JST
        - Install develop phase dependencies by default with carton install
        - carton exec now doesn't set PERL5OPT with lib::core::only, so as not to mess with
          the subprocess and site_perl modules (#60, #70, #82)

v0.9.53  2013-06-01 23:54:53 JST
        - use Moo
        - refactored installer/downloader as Carton::Builder

v0.9.52  2013-06-01 17:01:51 JST
        - carton exec doesn't need '--' before perl anymore #77
        - remove even more unused code
        - backed out color output support
        - stopped collecting dependencies from cpanfile, since cpanm installdeps can read it directly
        - Temporarily disabled check command for now
        - Upped cpanm dependency
        - Use vendor/cache for bundling since local is most likely gitignored #88

v0.9.51  2013-05-31 09:02:58 JST

v0.9.15  2013-03-31 18:11:28 PDT
        - Add minimum perl dependency

v0.9.14  2013-03-30 18:25:39 PDT
        - Unset $VERSION on PAUSE (Thanks andk)

v0.9.13  2013-03-30 15:14:49 PDT
        - repackage for better META files with Milla v0.9.3

v0.9.12  2013-03-30 15:01:55 PDT
        - repackage to set $VERSION

v0.9.11  2013-03-30 14:54:21 PDT
        - Ignore 'perl' requirements so as it won't fail, for now. #71
        - Install 'test' dependencies by default. #66
        - Convert to Milla, do not install carton-* man pages

v0.9.10 Tue Feb 26 13:32:34 PST 2013
        - Same as v0.9_9. Still considered pre-1.0!

v0.9_9  Wed Feb  6 11:02:46 PST 2013
        - Fixed bundle command where it updated modules, not the versions specified in carton.lock.
          bundle now builds mirror files like install --deployment, and downloads tarballs for the
          specified versions. (vti)

v0.9_8  Tue Feb  5 12:17:54 PST 2013
        - Do not use carton.lock to build extra dependencies. Everything has to be
          pulled out of cpanfile, even with the deployment mode. This makes the deployment
          much more reliable, and could possibly work with differing os/perl versions
          across development and deployments.

v0.9_7  Sat May 12 06:15:44 EEST 2012
        - Experimental multiple mirror support (nihen)
        - Fixed cpanm dependency to avoid cascading bug

v0.9_6  Thu May 10 21:05:35 CEST 2012
        - use cpanfile + Module::Install for dogfooding
        - `carton` without args now does `carton install` (inspired by bundler)
        - Update bundle command to use install.json (masaki)
        - code cleanups and doc overhauls
        - removed `uninstall` command for now
        - Fixed CPAN::Meta::Requirements dependency

v0.9_5  Thu Apr 12 19:39:19 JST 2012
        - Added experimental cpanfile support
        - Fixed POD (yanick)

        - use Capture::Tiny to capture output (wchristian)
        - Improve synopsis for exec (dagolden)
        - Implemented bundle command (masaki)
        - Fix Getopt::Long dependency (pfig)

        - Fixed packaging *again* by declaring version as a simple string
          via http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/369/version-numbers-should-be-boring/

v0.9.1  Mon Oct 17 19:05:12 JST 2011
        - Fixed packaging
        - Fixed UTF8 encoding warnings for JSON
