        - Add Module::CoreList as a dependency for perl 5.8

        - Use cpanm's fatscript interface rather than share dir

v0.9.66  2013-07-24 08:46:27 PDT
        - Correctly raises an exception when badly formatted snapshot file is read
        - Fixed a bug in tree scanner where seen hash is not preserved
        - tree scanner should be much faster for giant set of dependencies

v0.9.65  2013-07-23 18:51:59 PDT
        - BIG CHANGE: Use cpanfile.snapshot instead of carton.lock for 1.0 onwards
          There is no way to migrate carton.lock to cpanfile.snapshot just yet.
        - New cpanfile.snapshot is text based and is more VCS friendly

v0.9.60  2013-06-26 12:22:21 PDT
        - Bump MakeMaker and Module::Build dependencies to support test requires

v0.9.54  2013-06-02 12:38:20 JST
        - Install develop phase dependencies by default with carton install
        - carton exec now doesn't set PERL5OPT with lib::core::only, so as not to mess with
          the subprocess and site_perl modules (#60, #70, #82)

v0.9.53  2013-06-01 23:54:53 JST
        - use Moo
        - refactored installer/downloader as Carton::Builder

v0.9.52  2013-06-01 17:01:51 JST
        - carton exec doesn't need '--' before perl anymore #77
        - remove even more unused code
        - backed out color output support

        - Upped cpanm dependency
        - Use vendor/cache for bundling since local is most likely gitignored #88

v0.9.51  2013-05-31 09:02:58 JST
        - Documentation fixes

        - removed tree command for now

v0.9.15  2013-03-31 18:11:28 PDT
        - Add minimum perl dependency

v0.9.14  2013-03-30 18:25:39 PDT
        - Unset $VERSION on PAUSE (Thanks andk)

v0.9.13  2013-03-30 15:14:49 PDT
        - repackage for better META files with Milla v0.9.3

v0.9.12  2013-03-30 15:01:55 PDT

v0.9.10 Tue Feb 26 13:32:34 PST 2013
        - Same as v0.9_9. Still considered pre-1.0!

v0.9_9  Wed Feb  6 11:02:46 PST 2013
        - Fixed bundle command where it updated modules, not the versions specified in carton.lock.
          bundle now builds mirror files like install --deployment, and downloads tarballs for the
          specified versions. (vti)

v0.9_8  Tue Feb  5 12:17:54 PST 2013
        - Do not use carton.lock to build extra dependencies. Everything has to be
          pulled out of cpanfile, even with the deployment mode. This makes the deployment
          much more reliable, and could possibly work with differing os/perl versions
          across development and deployments.

v0.9_7  Sat May 12 06:15:44 EEST 2012
        - Experimental multiple mirror support (nihen)

        - Update bundle command to use install.json (masaki)
        - code cleanups and doc overhauls
        - removed `uninstall` command for now
        - Fixed CPAN::Meta::Requirements dependency

        - Improve synopsis for exec (dagolden)
        - Implemented bundle command (masaki)

          via http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/369/version-numbers-should-be-boring/

        - Fixed packaging
